**Describe the bug**

We used a CommandBar with AppBarButton with a Flyout in our UWP application. However, once we switched over to WinUI3 Preview 4 Desktop, the appearance of the button changed. 

The button in the WinUI3 Preview4 application has a ">" next to the icon whereas the UWP application did not. 

See Screenshots below to compare differences.

**Steps to reproduce the bug**
1. Clone the [WinUI3 Problems CommandBarFlyout repository](https://github.com/eleanorleffler/WinUI3Preview4_Problems_CommandBarFlyout).
2. Go to the CommandBarFlyoutWinUIPreview4 folder.
3. Open the CommandBarFlyoutWinUIPreview4 solution in Visual Studio 2019 Preview.
4. Build and run with Debug x64.
5. Notice the additional ">" next to the first icon in the CommandBar on the right side of the application.

**Expected behavior**

We expect to see no difference in appearance in the UWP and WinUI3 Preview 4 Desktop CommandBar buttons. The button in the WinUI3 Preview 4 Desktop application should only be the AppBarButton icon.

Build and run the CommandBarFlyoutUWP inside the CommandBarFlyoutUWP folder to see expected behavior.
