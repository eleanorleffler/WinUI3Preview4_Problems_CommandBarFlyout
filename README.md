# WinUI3Preview4_Problems_CommandBarFlyout

This repository contains two solutions with sample code demonstrating the difference in appearance of the 
AppBarButton with the Flyout on a CommandBar in both UWP and WinUI3 Preview4 Desktop.

The UWP sample code only displays the AppBarButton icon, which is expected. 

However, the WinUI3 Desktop sample code displays an additional ">" or arrow next to the AppBarButton icon, which is unexpected.

This issue has persisted from Preview 2 and 3.
